# Full_stack_app

This is my personal project for practicing my DevOps skills.

This is simple crud full stack app with database on the same container as backend.

I used hash as container tag for Development branch, but for Prod branch i used var from github as counter how many pushes i had and used that info as a tag for containers in Dockerhub.
